# Python Grade Assessment System (نظام تقدير الدرجات باستخدام Python)

## Overview
This project is a foundational Python script developed as part of self-study and university prerequisites. Its main function is to process a numerical average input (e.g., student score) and output the corresponding letter grade (Excellent, Very Good, Good, etc., or A, B, C, F).

## File Details
* **File Name:** `grade_calculator.py`
* **Language:** Python 3

## Key Features & Techniques Used
* **Conditional Logic (if/elif/else):** Extensive use of complex conditional statements to precisely map numerical ranges to specific academic grades.
* **Input Handling:** Effectively manages user input for the student's average score.
* **Purpose:** To demonstrate a solid understanding of fundamental programming control flow, data types, and logical decision-making in Python.
